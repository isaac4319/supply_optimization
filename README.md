Optimization of a Supply Chain using BigData ML techniques
With the current state of world supply chains being more volatile than ever before due to a changing geopolitical landscape it is key for companies to be on top of their supply chains at the most granular level with even small disruptions propagating quickly down the supply chain.
In this project, I have designed hybrid supply chain forecaster and optimizer. The data presented is notional and represents the expected inbound data collected from each warehouse regarding daily demand for products(defined as SKU'S (Stock Keeping Units)). In addition to this our operator receives inbound data on inventory and has a dataset which defines the cost of transporting a unit of each sku between each warehouse.
I have built a predictive model using the LGBMRegressor which performs well for tasks with noisy data such as supply chain data which in the real world would be very prone to erros which quickly propagate further down the chain. I then have added an optimizer to be able to allow our operator to be able to quickly redistribute stock according to the predicted next day forecast while minimizing transport costs. 
Finally the application has been packaged into a streamlit app to allow the operator to be able to quickly see the trends in forecasted supply as well as quickly reallocate stock.
